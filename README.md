# Interpreter for Scheme (R5RS) written in C.

## Phase 1: Linked List
To implement a linked list that will be used throughout the interpreter project.
## Phase 2: Talloc("tracked malloc")
To create a garbage collector to manage memory usage throughout the interpreter project.
## Phase 3: Tokenizer
To implement a tokenizer for Scheme in C.
## Phase 4: Parser
To parse the tokens into a syntax tree.
## Phase 5: Eval
To evaluate the Scheme code. Specifically allow the evaluation of
bounded variables, if, let and quote special forms.
## Phase 6: Apply
Extend the evaluator's ability to handle define and lambda special forms.
## Phase 7: Primitives
